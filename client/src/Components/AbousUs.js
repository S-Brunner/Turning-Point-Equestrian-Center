                        With a vision of sharing God`s love with people, Fred and Jean Warnholtz signed the original property deed for Parkside Ranch in 1964. Parkside Ranch was incorporated in 1969 as a non-profit corporation. Early on campers slept in tents and there were two cabins that housed the kitchen and washrooms. Over the last 50+ years, Parkside`s facilities have expanded and changed however the mission of sharing God`s love with people has remained.
